            The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled
            tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly
            related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some
            cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in
            charge, involved with the operation of eutiveumsonho
            (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or

            <br />
            <br />
            Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
            transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To
            find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
            Data, Users can check the section containing details about the

            processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they

        <h2>Further Information for Users in the European Union </h2>

        <p>
          This section applies to all Users in the European Union, according to
          the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and, for such
          Users, supersedes any other possibly divergent or conflicting
          information contained in the privacy policy. Further details regarding
          the categories of Data processed, the purposes of processing, the
          categories of recipients of the Personal Data, if any, and further
          information about Personal Data can be found in{" "}
          <strong>
            the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of
            Personal Data” within this document
          </strong>
          .
        </p>

        <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
          following applies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
            with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
            which the Owner is subject;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
            interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
            Owner;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
            pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
          basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
          provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement,
          or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.{" "}
        </p>

        <h3>Further information about retention time</h3>

        <p>
          Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be
          processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have
          been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable
          legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a
            contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such
            contract has been fully performed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate
            interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such
            purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
            legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant
            sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
          whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as
          such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
          to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to
          fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after expiration of the retention period.

          <li>
            <strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the

            <strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn if
            Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding

            undergoing processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right
            to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or
            corrected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have
            the right to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case,

          <li>
            <strong>

            Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly
            used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to
            have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> Users have the right to bring a

        <p>
          Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis for Data
          transfers abroad including to any international organization governed
          by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such
          as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to
          safeguard their Data.
        </p>

        <h4>Details about the right to object to processing</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the
            exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the
            purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may
            object to such processing by providing a ground related to their
            particular situation to justify the objection.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be
            processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that
            processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any
            justification. Where the User objects to processing for direct
            marketing purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed
            for such purposes. To learn whether the Owner is processing Personal
            Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant
            sections of this document.{" "}

        <h4>How to exercise these rights</h4>
        <p>
          Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner
          through the contact details provided in this document. Such requests
          are free of charge and will be answered by the Owner as early as
          possible and always within one month, providing Users with the
          information required by law. Any rectification or erasure of Personal
          Data or restriction of processing will be communicated by the Owner to
          each recipient, if any, to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed
          unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. At
          the Users’ request, the Owner will inform them about those recipients.

            make sure to communicate to you the factual or legal reasons that

            information to be delivered in electronic or printed form. <br />{" "}
            You will also need to let us know whether you want us to answer your

            fashion, or if you need a complete disclosure instead. <br /> In the
            latter case, we’ll respond within 15 days from the time of your
            request, providing you with all the information on the origin of
            your personal information, confirmation on whether or not records

            We may use your personal information to allow the operational

            We won’t process your information for unexpected purposes, or for

            submit requests via any forms on eutiveumsonho. You also provide

            portability
          </h4>
          <p>You have the right to request that we disclose to you:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the categories of personal information that we collect about you;
            </li>

              to whom.
            </b>{" "}
            In particular, you have the right to request two separate lists from
            us where we disclose:

          <ul>
            <li>

              was disclosed for a business purpose.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal
            information collected or used over the past 12 months.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed
            will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to
            enable you to transmit the information to another entity without
            hindrance — provided that this is technically feasible.
          </p>

          <h4>
            The right to request the deletion of your personal information
          </h4>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
            information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as,
            including but not limited to, where the information is used to
            identify and repair errors on eutiveumsonho, to detect security
            incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to
            exercise certain rights etc.).

          <p>
            If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right,
            we will delete your personal information and notify any of our
            service providers and all third parties to whom we have sold or
            shared the personal information to do so — provided that this is
            technically feasible and doesn’t involve disproportionate effort.
          </p>

          <h4>The right to correct inaccurate personal information</h4>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate
            personal information we maintain about you, taking into account the
            nature of the personal information and the purposes of the
            processing of the personal information.

          <h4>

            You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your

            The right of no retaliation following opt-out or exercise of other
            rights (the right to non-discrimination)
          </h4>
          <p>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights
            under the CCPA. This means that we will not discriminate against
            you, including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services,
            charging you a different price, or providing a different level or
            quality of goods or services just because you exercised your
            consumer privacy rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or
            ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that
            personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with
            goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions,
            discounts, and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or
            selling your personal information, provided that the financial
            incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your
            personal information.
          </p>

          <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
          <p>
            To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your
            verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided
            in this document.
          </p>
          <p>
            For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who
            you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making
            a verifiable request which must:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
              you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
              an authorized representative;
            </li>
            <li>
              describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
              properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your
            identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our
            possession actually relates to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create
            an account with us. We will use any personal information collected
            from you in connection with the verification of your request solely
            for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the
            personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes
            of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can
            authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State
            to act on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of
            a child under your parental authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12
            months.
          </p>

          <h4>How and when we are expected to handle your request</h4>
          <p>
            We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days
            and provide information about how we will process your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt.
            Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why,
            and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we
            may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period. Only
            with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1,
            2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information
            beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless
            doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate
            effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind
            our denial.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
            request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In
            such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the
            request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain
            the reasons behind it.

              personal data. You also have the right to access such personal
              data.

              about you, taking into account the nature of the personal data and
              the purposes of the processing of the personal data.

              <b>non-discrimination.</b> We will not discriminate against you

              different price, or provide a different level or quality of goods
              or services just because you exercised your consumer privacy
              rights. However, if you refuse to provide your personal data to us
              or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal data, and that

          <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
          <p>
            To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your
            request to us by contacting us via the contact details provided in
            this document.
          </p>
          <p>For us to respond to your request, we need to know who you are.</p>
          <p>
            We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your
            identity using commercially reasonable efforts and therefore confirm
            that the personal data in our possession actually relate to you. In
            such cases, we may request that you provide additional information
            which is reasonably necessary to authenticate you and your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making a consumer request does not require you to create an account
            with us. However, we may require you to use your existing account.
            We will use any personal data collected from you in connection with
            your request solely for the purposes of authentication, without
            further disclosing the personal data, retaining it longer than
            necessary for purposes of authentication, or using it for unrelated
            purposes.

            We will respond to your request without undue delay, but in all

            more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up
            to 90 days to fulfill your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should we deny your request, we will explain to you the reasons
            behind our denial without undue delay, but in all cases and at the
            latest within 45 days of receipt of the request. It is your right to

            For our purposes, the word "third party" means "a natural or legal
            person, public authority, agency, or body other than the consumer,
            controller, processor, or an affiliate of the processor or the

          <p>
            For our purposes, the word "third party" means "a person, public

            Please note that according to the CPA, the disclosure of personal
            data to a processor that processes personal data on behalf of a
            controller does not constitute a sale. In addition, other specific
            exceptions set forth in the CPA may apply, such as, but not limited
