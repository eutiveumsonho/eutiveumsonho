        <p>
          This document informs Users about the technologies that help
          eutiveumsonho to achieve the purposes described below. Such
          technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for
          example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a
          script) on a User&apos;s device as they interact with eutiveumsonho.
        </p>
        <p>
          For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within
          this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.
          <br />
          For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile
          browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context
          of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason,
          within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is
          specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the
          User's consent, depending on the applicable law. Whenever consent is
          given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the
          instructions provided in this document.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eutiveumsonho only uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner
          (so-called &quot;first-party&quot; Trackers).
          <br />
          The validity and expiration periods of first-party Cookies and other
          similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner.
          Some of them expire upon termination of the User&apos;s browsing
          session.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Activities strictly necessary for the operation of eutiveumsonho and
          delivery of the Service
        </h3>

        <p>
          Eutiveumsonho uses so-called &quot;technical&quot; Cookies and other
          similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly necessary
          for the operation or delivery of the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent</h3>

        <p>
          There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to
          provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within
          their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or
          storage of Trackers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users
          can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences
          within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly
          via the relevant consent-preferences privacy widget, if available.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to
          delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember
          the User&apos;s initial consent preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other Trackers in the browser&apos;s local memory may be cleared by
          deleting the browsing history.
        </p>

        <h4>Locating Tracker Settings</h4>

        <p>
          Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile
          apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device
          advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in
          general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant
          setting).
        </p>

        <h4>Consequences of denying the use of Trackers</h4>
        <p>
          Users are free to decide whether or not to allow the use of Trackers.
          However, please note that Trackers help eutiveumsonho to provide a
          better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in line with
          the purposes outlined in this document). Therefore, if the User
          chooses to block the use of Trackers, the Owner may be unable to
          provide related features.
