          way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby
          substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.
          <br />
          In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable

          Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or
          impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall
          not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are
          essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties
          would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the
